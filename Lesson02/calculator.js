/* Write a program called calculator.js. We've demonstrated using CodePen. Feel free to use this tool or another that you are comfortable with.

The calculator will need 4 variables; use all the operators and console log the result of using the two variables. Mix and match the variables in the operators.

Save your work to the Lesson02 directory.
